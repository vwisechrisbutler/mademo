    <p>The projections presented are only illustrations and the actual periodic payments that may be purchased or available at retirement will depend on numerous factors and may vary substantially from these projections. The assumptions used to project earnings and life expectancy may vary substantially from actual earnings and longevity. These projections do not take into account Social Security benefits or income or other taxes that may be levied on benefit payments. For the purpose of these illustrations we use the normal retirement age as specified by your retirement plan (usually age 65). If your age is the same as or greater than that normal retirement age we will use your actual age. If you are married, your spouse is assumed to be the same age.</p>
    <p>In order to provide these projections, we assumed that your retirement plan contributions continue through to your normal retirement age with an assumed rate of return of 4% and a 3% inflation rate. The assumed interest rate is equal to the rate on the 10-year constant maturity Treasury security rate. The estimated monthly payments are based on life expectancy tables as provided by the Internal Revenue Code (section 417)e)(3)(B). We encourage you to seek personalized advice from qualified professionals regarding all personal finance issues.</p>
